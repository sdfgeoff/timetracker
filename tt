# TimeTracker is a nerd-compliant time tracking system
# Every time your tt it will open an editor for the previous time area
# allowing you to describe what you did. After saving it it will open an 
# editor for the next time period, allowing you to describe what you plan to
# do. This is saved in a file with the timestamp of the start as the filename.
# 
# Optionally you can pass in the time you changed task. This is parsed by 
# date -d, so can either be a time (eg tt "17:10") or a complete datestring 
# (eg tt "2017-03-05 17:10"). If it already exists, you will edit the existing
# entry
# Additionally you can pass in -r to edit the most recent existing one
#
# To indicate that you're not working on anything, leave the field blank
# Hopefully one day this may also include programs to analyze the time tracked
