This is a nerd-compliant time tracking tool. How do you use it?

Run `tt` and fill in the fields with what you have done over the
past time. If you were taking a break, you can run `tt -b` which 
will auto-fill the project with "Break"

If you make a mistake, run `tt -p` to edit the previous entry
If you want to create an entry at a specific time, run `tt "17:10"`
